# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for the Obsidian VCF Contacts plugin.

## Planning Documents

### [Implementation Roadmap](implementation-roadmap.md)

**Purpose**: High-level phased implementation plan

**Contents**:
- Project overview and technical constraints
- Current state analysis
- Six implementation phases with goals
- Recommended implementation order
- Success criteria and risk mitigation
- Timeline estimates

**Use this when**: You need to understand the overall implementation strategy and phases.

---

### [Class Structure and Dependencies](class-structure.md)

**Purpose**: Detailed class definitions and architecture

**Contents**:
- Class-by-class breakdown with properties and methods
- TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- Dependency graph
- Module organization
- Implementation guidelines

**Use this when**: You're implementing a specific class and need to understand its interface, methods, and dependencies.

---

### [Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md)

**Purpose**: Actionable task list for implementation

**Contents**:
- Detailed tasks for each phase
- Effort estimates per task
- Sprint planning (2-week iterations)
- Success metrics
- Risk management
- Testing requirements

**Use this when**: You're planning work, tracking progress, or need specific implementation tasks.

---

## How to Use These Plans

### For Project Planning

1. Start with [Implementation Roadmap](implementation-roadmap.md) for the big picture
2. Review [Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md) for effort estimates and sprints
3. Use sprint planning sections to organize work

### For Development

1. Check [Class Structure](class-structure.md) for the class you're implementing
2. Reference [Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md) for specific tasks
3. Cross-reference with specifications in `/project/specifications/`

### For Progress Tracking

1. Use [Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md) checkboxes to track completion
2. Update task statuses as work progresses
3. Note any deviations from the plan

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is organized into six phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Data Models** (6-8 days)
   - VcardFile model for VCF parsing/generation
   - ContactNote model for individual contact operations

2. **Phase 2: Contact Collection Management** (5-7 days)
   - ContactManager for vault-wide contact management
   - VcardManager for VCF file collection management

3. **Phase 3: Curator Pipeline System** (7-10 days)
   - CuratorManager for processor coordination
   - Standard curator processors for data operations

4. **Phase 4: Plugin Services** (4-6 days)
   - SyncWatcher for VCF file monitoring
   - Drop handler for VCF imports
   - vdirsyncer integration

5. **Phase 5: User Interface Components** (2-3 days)
   - FolderSuggest for path completion
   - Config modals

6. **Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure** (2-3 days)
   - Integration tests
   - User story validation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 28-40 days

## Key Principles

### Architecture

- **Model-based organization**: Domain logic in model classes
- **Processor pattern**: Data operations as curator processors
- **Sequential execution**: Prevent race conditions
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Dependency injection**: For testability

### Implementation

- **Bottom-up approach**: Build foundations first
- **Test as you go**: Unit tests with each component
- **Incremental complexity**: Start simple, add features
- **Library delegation**: Use external libraries for standards compliance
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments and clear interfaces

### Quality

- **No data loss**: Always read-modify-write pattern
- **Performance**: Caching and efficient data structures
- **Standards compliance**: vCard 4.0, YAML 1.2, CommonMark
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation, clear errors
- **Testing**: >80% code coverage

## Dependencies Between Phases

```
Phase 1 (Core Data Models)
  ↓
Phase 2 (Contact Collection Management)
  ↓
Phase 3 (Curator Pipeline System)
  ↓
Phase 4 (Plugin Services)
  ↓
Phase 5 (UI Components)

Phase 6 (Testing) runs throughout all phases
```

Each phase builds on the previous ones. You cannot skip phases, but you can implement tasks within a phase in parallel if they don't have dependencies.

---

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

- ✅ All specifications are satisfied
- ✅ All user stories can be demonstrated
- ✅ Tests have >80% coverage
- ✅ Plugin loads and runs in Obsidian
- ✅ VCF sync works bidirectionally
- ✅ Relationship management functions correctly
- ✅ Contact section displays and syncs properly
- ✅ No data loss during operations
- ✅ Performance is acceptable with large datasets

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Review all planning documents** in this directory
2. **Read the specifications** in `/project/specifications/`
3. **Understand the user stories** in `/project/user-stories.md`
4. **Setup development environment** (npm install)
5. **Begin Phase 1.1** (VcardFile model)

## Questions or Feedback

If you have questions about the implementation plan:

1. Review the planning documents thoroughly
2. Check the specifications for technical details
3. Consult user stories for context
4. Update plans as needed based on implementation learnings

---

## Plan Maintenance

These plans should be updated:

- When significant deviations occur
- When new requirements emerge
- When effort estimates change significantly
- When dependencies change
- After major milestones are completed

Keep the plans as living documents that reflect the actual implementation approach.
